First of all, I must warn you that I use free hosting for the demo link, so sometimes there are lags and incomplete rendering. So if something doesn't work well, reload the page (sometimes you even have to do it several times)

This project calculates the prices of various SDN services, depending on the selected number of GB, and visually shows which is the cheapest.

First of all, you need to select the options on the radio buttons for the correct operation of the calculator.

PS unfortunately, I have no design skills, so I apologize for the visual part, in this project the main focus was on functionality.
